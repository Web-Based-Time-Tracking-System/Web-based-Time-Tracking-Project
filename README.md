                                            Introduction

In today’s fast-paced and ever-evolving workplace environment, managing employee time effectively is a critical task for ensuring accurate payroll, optimizing productivity, and maintaining compliance with labour laws. Traditional methods of time tracking, such as paper forms, spreadsheets, and outdated software, are often riddled with inefficiencies, errors, and time-consuming processes. These outdated systems make it challenging for employees to accurately log their working hours, for managers to track employee performance, and for organizations to process payroll in a timely manner.
The goal of this proposal is to introduce a Web-Based Time Tracking System that will automate and streamline the process of tracking employee working hours, calculating overtime, and generating real-time reports. By moving away from traditional methods and adopting a digital, user-friendly system, organizations can significantly reduce errors, improve operational efficiency, and enhance overall transparency in time management.

1. Problem Diagnosis:
   
Problem Domain Overview

Time tracking is an essential task in many organizations to manage employee working hours, ensure accurate payroll, and track productivity. However, traditional methods like paper forms, spreadsheets, or outdated software often result in inefficiencies, inaccuracies, and confusion. These methods are prone to errors, lack real-time visibility, and make overtime calculation complicated.
In many workplaces:
•	Employees manually record their work hours on paper or digital timesheets.
•	Managers spend considerable time verifying and correcting time entries.
•	Overtime calculations are manually performed, leading to inconsistencies.
•	Generating reports for payroll or performance analysis is slow and error-prone.
•	Data on employee work hours is often scattered across different systems, making it hard to access or analyse.

The goal of this project is to develop a web-based time tracking system that will simplify the process of tracking employee hours, automatically calculate overtime, and generate comprehensive reports with minimal human intervention.
Specific Issues to Address
     1.	Inaccuracy in Time Entry: Employees might forget to log hours, or errors can occur when logging times manually.
     2.	Time-Consuming Manual Calculations: Managers often need to manually calculate overtime and total working hours, which takes up valuable 
        time.
     3.	Lack of Real-Time Monitoring: Without an automated system, managers cannot track employee hours in real-time, leading to issues such as 
    missed overtime opportunities or unapproved excess hours.
     4.	Inefficient Report Generation: Compiling data from various sources for payroll or compliance reporting is time-consuming and prone to 
     errors.
      5.	Poor Integration: In many systems, data is siloed, and there’s no easy way to integrate time-tracking information with payroll or 
       accounting systems.
       
                             Research & Insights

Through interviews with HR personnel, managers, and employees, we learned that:
•	Many organizations still rely on outdated systems, leading to delays and frustration.
•	Employees have trouble ensuring that their overtime is recorded correctly, leading to disputes.
•	Managers spend a lot of time fixing and approving time logs.

                                      PROPOSAL TREATMENT
Solution Overview

We propose a web-based time tracking system that automates the time entry process, calculates overtime based on company policies, and generates real-time reports for payroll and analysis. The system will be designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring that both employees and managers can use it without extensive training.
How We’ll Address the Problems
•	Automated Time Tracking: Employees will clock in and out using the system. Their hours will be automatically recorded, reducing the chance of errors.
•	Overtime Calculation: The system will automatically calculate overtime according to predefined rules (e.g., time worked over 40 hours per week). This will eliminate manual calculation mistakes and ensure employees are paid correctly.
•	Real-Time Reporting: Managers can view and download reports of employee hours on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. This will save time on data aggregation and improve decision-making.
•	Admin Interface: Administrators will have an easy-to-use interface to manage employee time records, approve or edit timesheets, and generate compliance reports.
Interventions and Metrics for Success:
•	Business Value:
o	Efficiency: Employees will save time by using an automated time logging system. Managers will save time by avoiding manual timesheet approval.
o	Accuracy: The system’s automation will reduce human error in time logging and overtime calculations.
o	Cost Savings: With fewer errors and faster reporting, businesses will save both time and money.
o	Compliance: Accurate records will help organizations comply with labour laws and internal auditing requirements.

Expected Improvements Over Current Practices:
o	Faster Payroll
o	 Processing: Automated time and overtime tracking will reduce payroll processing time.
o	Transparency: Employees will be able to track their own time, which will reduce disputes over hours worked and overtime.
o	Better Decision Making: Managers will have real-time data on employee hours and productivity, which will help in making more informed decisions.
Detailed Scenario Example:
1.	Employee: An employee clocks in when they start work and clocks out when they finish. The system automatically tracks the total working hours. If they work more than 40 hours in a week, the system will flag overtime hours and calculate the additional pay.
o	Benefit: The employee doesn’t need to manually track hours or worry about overtime calculation.
2.	Manager: The manager reviews the time logs, approves them with one click, and generates a report that can be directly sent to payroll. If there are any discrepancies (e.g., missed clock-in), the system flags it for review.
o	Benefit: The manager’s time spent on reviewing and approving timesheets is significantly reduced.

3. Plan of Work:
Project Breakdown & Timeline
1.	MONDAY:
o	Research and Requirement Gathering: Conduct interviews with users (employees and managers) to understand their specific needs and challenges. Define system requirements.
